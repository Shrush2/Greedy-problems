Ninja and his friends went to a restaurant on the occasion of Ninja’s birthday. There he was offered by his friends to do some task, if he wins, he would not have to pay a single penny, his friends would pay instead of him. But if he loses, he would have to pay the whole bill. The task was that he was given a bar of chocolate and was asked to break it into single squares.

The rules were as follows:

1.Parts of the chocolate may be broken along the vertical and horizontal lines as indicated by the broken lines in the picture.

2.Each break of a part of the chocolate is charged a cost expressed by a positive integer.

3.This cost does not depend on the size of the part that is being broken but only depends on the line the break goes along.

4.Denoting the costs of breaking along consecutive vertical lines with x1, x2, ..., xm-1 and along horizontal lines with y1, y2, ..., yn-1.

5.The cost of breaking the whole bar into single squares is the sum of the successive breaks.


Now, Ninja has to break the chocolate in such a way that results in minimum cost. So your task is to find the minimum cost.

6 4
2 1 3 1 4
4 1 2
2 2

Sample Output 1 :
42
8
Explanation of sample input 1 :
Test Case 1:

In the first line, there is the number of test cases i.e. 2 and in the next line, 6 and 4 are the number of rows and columns of the chocolate following the horizontal costs [2,1,3,1,4] and then the vertical costs [4,1,2]. 
Here, we have started with breaking from the vertical lines that cost 4 and then breaking the two parts from the horizontal line costing 4 and so on.
‘4+(4*2)+ (3*2)+(2*3)+(2*3)+(1*4)+(2*4)’ = ‘42’.

T.C => O(n log n) + O(m log m)
S.C => O(m + n)
